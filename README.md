This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing loan information from a private financial firm. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics of the loans, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or outliers that may impact decision-making processes.

### Features

- Importing necessary modules including numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, datetime, and seaborn.

- Loading the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.

- Performing EDA to understand the structure and content of the data.

- Handling naming conventions and data type conversions for consistency and clarity.

- Visualizing key aspects of the data using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Treating missing values to ensure data integrity.

- Identifying and addressing outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

- Standardizing the data to facilitate comparisons and analyses.

### Tool Used : Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps

**Data Import:** Utilize Python libraries such as pandas to import the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.

**Data Exploration:** Explore the structure and content of the dataset to understand its features, data types, and overall distribution.

**Data Cleaning:**

Handle naming conventions and data type conversions for consistency and clarity.

Treat missing values using appropriate techniques to ensure data integrity.

**Data Visualization:** Utilize matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships and distributions within the data.

**Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identify and address outliers using methods like the interquartile range (IQR) to ensure accurate analysis.

**Data Standardization:** Standardize the data to facilitate comparisons and analyses, ensuring consistency across variables.
